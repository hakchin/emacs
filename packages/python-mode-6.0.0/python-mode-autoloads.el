(autoload 'doctest-register-mmm-classes "doctest-mode" "\
Register doctest's mmm classes, allowing doctest to be used as a
submode region in other major modes, such as python-mode and rst-mode.
Two classes are registered:

`doctest-docstring'

    Used to edit docstrings containing doctest examples in python-
    mode.  Docstring submode regions start and end with triple-quoted
    strings (\"\"\").  In order to avoid confusing start-string
    markers and end-string markers, all triple-quote strings in the
    buffer are treated as submode regions (even if they're not
    actually docstrings).  Use (C-c % C-d) to insert a new doctest-
    docstring region.  When `doctest-execute' (C-c C-c) is called
    inside a doctest-docstring region, it executes just the current
    docstring.  The globals for this execution are constructed by
    importing the current buffer's contents in Python.

`doctest-example'

    Used to edit doctest examples in text-editing modes, such as
    `rst-mode' or `text-mode'.  Docstring submode regions start with
    optionally indented prompts (>>>) and end with blank lines.  Use
    (C-c % C-e) to insert a new doctest-example region.  When
    `doctest-execute' (C-c C-c) is called inside a doctest-example
    region, it executes all examples in the buffer.

If ADD-MODE-EXT-CLASSES is true, then register the new classes in
`mmm-mode-ext-classes-alist', which will cause them to be used by
default in the following modes:

    doctest-docstring:  python-mode
    doctest-example:    rst-mode

If FIX-MMM-FONTIFY-REGION-BUG is true, then register a hook that will
fix a bug in `mmm-fontify-region' that affects some (but not all)
versions of emacs.  (See `doctest-fixed-mmm-fontify-region' for more
info.)

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.doctest$" . doctest-mode))

(autoload 'doctest-mode "doctest-mode" "\
A major mode for editing text files that contain Python
doctest examples.  Doctest is a testing framework for Python that
emulates an interactive session, and checks the result of each
command.  For more information, see the Python library reference:
<http://docs.python.org/lib/module-doctest.html>

`doctest-mode' defines three kinds of line, each of which is
treated differently:

  - 'Source lines' are lines consisting of a Python prompt
    ('>>>' or '...'), followed by source code.  Source lines are
    colored (similarly to `python-mode') and auto-indented.

  - 'Output lines' are non-blank lines immediately following
    source lines.  They are colored using several doctest-
    specific output faces.

  - 'Text lines' are any other lines.  They are not processed in
    any special way.

Major mode for editing Python files.
To submit a problem report, enter `\\[py-submit-bug-report]' from a
`python-mode' buffer.  Do `\\[py-describe-mode]' for detailed
documentation.  To see what version of `python-mode' you are running,
enter `\\[py-version]'.

This mode knows about Python indentation, tokens, comments and
continuation lines.  Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.

(autoload 'py-shell "python-mode" "\
Start an interactive Python interpreter in another window.
This is like Shell mode, except that Python is running in the window
instead of a shell.  See the `Interactive Shell' and `Shell Mode'
sections of the Emacs manual for details, especially for the key
bindings active in the `*Python*' buffer.

With optional \\[universal-argument], the user is prompted for the
flags to pass to the Python interpreter.  This has no effect when this
command is used to switch to an existing process, only when a new
process is started.  If you use this, you will probably want to ensure
that the current arguments are retained (they will be included in the
prompt).  This argument is ignored when this function is called
programmatically, or when running in Emacs 19.34 or older.

Note: You can toggle between using the CPython interpreter and the
Jython interpreter by hitting \\[py-toggle-shells].  This toggles
buffer local variables which control whether all your subshell
interactions happen to the `*Jython*' or `*Python*' buffers (the
latter is the name used for the CPython buffer).

Warning: Don't use an interactive Python if you change sys.ps1 or
sys.ps2 from their default values, or if you're running code that
prints `>>> ' or `... ' at the start of a line.  `python-mode' can't
distinguish your output from Python's output, and assumes that `>>> '
at the start of a line is a prompt from Python.  Similarly, the Emacs
Shell mode code assumes that both `>>> ' and `... ' at the start of a
line are Python prompts.  Bad things can happen if you fool either
mode.

Warning:  If you do any editing *in* the process buffer *while* the
buffer is accepting output from Python, do NOT attempt to `undo' the
changes.  Some of the output (nowhere near the parts you changed!) may
be lost if you do.  This appears to be an Emacs bug, an unfortunate
interaction between undo and process filters; the same problem exists in
non-Python process buffers using the default (Emacs-supplied) process
filter.
